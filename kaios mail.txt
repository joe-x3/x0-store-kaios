Subject: Request for Clarification and Review of Unpublished App on KaiOS Store

Dear KaiOS Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my concern regarding an issue with my submitted app on the KaiOS Store. My app was unpublished without any prior notification or explanation from your side. Despite multiple follow-up emails over the past few weeks, I have not received any response or update about the reason for the unpublishing, nor have I seen any action taken to review the app again.

This lack of communication has created significant confusion and uncertainty. As a developer, timely feedback and clarity are essential for maintaining the quality and compliance of my application with your platformâ€™s standards.

I kindly request the following:

A clear explanation for why my app was unpublished.

Confirmation that my app is being reviewed again.

A timeline for when I can expect further updates or a resolution.

I am committed to making any necessary changes required for compliance. I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and look forward to your response.

Thank you for your time and support.

Warm regards,
[Vivek GYAN 7.0]
